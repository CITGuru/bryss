# How to Contribute

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the Bryss Framework repository
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the dev branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-12 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md).

## Unit Testing

I have not implemented the testing yet, still getting used to PHPUnit. Once testing has been implemented, all pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. I'll be using PHPUnit for the testing.
